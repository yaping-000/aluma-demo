# Database Migration Guide

## ðŸš¨ **Required: Add business_name column to database**

The onboarding form data is not being saved because the `business_name` column is missing from your Supabase database.

## ðŸ“‹ **Step-by-Step Migration**

### 1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**

- Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Select your project: `poondlknkfsyogkrrwaf`

### 2. **Open SQL Editor**

- Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
- Click "New query"

### 3. **Run the Migration**

Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Add business_name column to existing users table
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS business_name TEXT;

-- Add comment explaining the new column
COMMENT ON COLUMN users.business_name IS 'Business/organization name for AI personalization';

-- Verify the column was added
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'users' AND column_name = 'business_name';
```

### 4. **Execute the Query**

- Click the "Run" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
- You should see a success message and the column verification

### 5. **Verify the Migration**

You should see output like:

```
column_name    | data_type | is_nullable
business_name  | text      | YES
```

## âœ… **After Migration**

Once the migration is complete:

1. The onboarding form will save data successfully
2. The `company` field will be stored as `business_name` in the database
3. The `emailContact` field will be stored as `consent` in the database

## ðŸ§ª **Test the Fix**

After running the migration, test the onboarding form:

1. Fill out the form with test data
2. Submit the form
3. Check your Supabase dashboard â†’ Table Editor â†’ users table
4. You should see the new user data with the `business_name` field populated

## ðŸš¨ **If Migration Fails**

If you get an error during migration:

1. Check that you're in the correct Supabase project
2. Ensure you have admin permissions
3. Try running just the ALTER TABLE command first
4. Contact Supabase support if needed
